As well as reducing maintenence burden as things change, this also\nhelps human maintainers to understand how objects relate to one another,\nhelping to turn a sea of infrastructure spread across many systems into a\nwell-understood, version-controlled dependency graph.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terraform's Getting Started guide</a> covers basic usage of Terraform,\nincluding how to describe a simple set of resources in a single configuration\nand create, update and destroy those resources. This article describes a more\ncomplex use of Terraform for managing a large system consisting of several\ndifferent <em>applications</em> that use a mixture of shared and dedicated\ninfrastructure, deployed in two or more separate <em>environments</em> that allow for\nchanges to be staged before they are released to production.</p><p>Due to the two major components involved, I call this (unimaginitively!)\n<em>the Environment+Application Pattern</em>, or <strong>the E+A Pattern</strong> for short.</p><ol class='parts'><li><a href='overview.html'>Part 1: Overview and Definitions</a></li><li><a href='creating-environments.html'>Part 2: Creating Environments</a></li><li><a href='per-application-configuration.html'>Part 3: Per-application Configuration</a></li><li><a href='join-environment-module.html'>Part 4: The \"Join Environment\" Module</a></li><li><a href='conclusion.html'>Part 5: Conclusion</a></li><li><a href='bonus-patterns.html'>Part 6: Bonus Patterns</a></li></ol><aside class='note'><p>I wrote this series of articles when I worked at <a href=\"https://www.saymedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Say Media</a>, and it\ndescribes a generalized version of the Terraform design pattern used there.\nI now work at Hashicorp on Terraform itself.</p><p>This article is not an official opinion of either Say Media <em>or</em> Hashicorp,\nand in particular should not be taken as an official recommendation from\nthe Terraform team.</p></aside>", "mainImageUrl": "/terraform-environment-application-pattern/None", "title": "Terraform Environment+Application Design Pattern", "url": "/terraform-environment-application-pattern/", "summary": "A design pattern for managing shared infrastructure and application deployment using Hashicorp Terraform", "date": "2017-02-18", "type": "Deployment"}}, "path": "/:slug/"}
